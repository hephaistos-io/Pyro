|Term |Definition

|bucket4j
|Java rate limiting library that implements the token bucket algorithm. Used with Redis backend for distributed rate limiting.

|Environment
|A deployment context for an application (e.g., production, staging, development). Each environment has its own rate limits and usage tracking.

|Fail-open
|A resilience pattern where the system allows requests through when a dependency (like Redis) is unavailable, prioritizing availability over strict enforcement.

|Peak RPS
|Peak Requests Per Second - the highest number of requests observed in any single second during a time period.

|Rate Limiting
|Controlling the rate of incoming requests to prevent abuse and ensure fair resource allocation. FlagForge uses per-second token bucket rate limiting.

|Redis
|In-memory data store used for rate limiting (via bucket4j) and real-time usage counter storage. Provides sub-millisecond latency for per-request operations.

|Token Bucket
|Rate limiting algorithm where tokens are added to a bucket at a fixed rate, and each request consumes one token. Requests are denied when the bucket is empty.

|TTL
|Time To Live - the duration after which a Redis key automatically expires and is deleted. Used to manage memory and ensure stale data cleanup.

|Usage Aggregation
|The process of reading real-time counters from Redis and persisting them to PostgreSQL for historical queries and dashboards.
